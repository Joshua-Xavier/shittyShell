BACKLOG:

-----------------------
THINK ABOUT:
- how to handle arguments
- probs have to use something like strsep
- and/or could refer to a preset table of valid commands?
- !The string echo "hello \" does not behave as expected
- need to clean up code
- need to make test case group
- probs best just to use regular expressions to ensure correctness?
- need to change help so functionality is more similar to less/more, so that you can
scroll through long pages?
- add regex for single arg/null arg matching
